# Python-PIR-Email
Python Code to allow PIR feedback to be sent via email I am interfacing a raspbeery Pi and a PIR motion sensor in my project to detect motion and display feedback. i have connecetd the Output of the PIR to pin 18, the power supply to PIN 17(3.3v), and the ground to pin 9. But now i want to send the feedback via email using smtp. I found this code at https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=32&t=85088 But appearently it is wrong, but i dont know where exactly the mistake is. Any help with the code review, links to working code and any kind of help is appreciated.
